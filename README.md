What is Fun with 5-4-3-2-1

  Fun with 5-4-3-2-1 is a mindfulness interactive tool created on Scratch that enables users to be calm
  and relaxed by using the 5-4-3-2-1 method. The method asks users to focus on 5 things they can see, 4
  things they can touch, 3 things they can hear, 2 things they can smell and 1 thing they can taste.
